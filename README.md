# GMod-Server-Whitelist
An addon for Garry's Mod servers, allows you to create a whitelist that (dis)allows access based upon SteamID  
  
I haven't touched this addon in forever, and now that I look back at it, I can see the code's really ugly. I may come back to this if I ever get bored (which I probably will this summer) and fix it up. Feel free to fix it yourself if you wanna, I pretty much put it on GitHub for explicitly that reason
